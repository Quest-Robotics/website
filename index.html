                        <p>
                            FTC is an acronym for the "FIRST Tech Challenge". 
                            The program is part of a K-12 competition run by the non-profit organization FIRST. 
                            The program culminates in a series of robotics competitions, where teams can showcase their work through the 5 month season, and participate in competitive robot matches. 
                            FTC's main focus is to promote the STEM among highschoolers, which is evident with each aspect of the competition. 
                            We specialize in outreach, documentation, design, and hardware. 
                            Outreach involves spreading stem in the community through teaching and community events, where we showcase our robot, team, and the STEM field in general. 
                            Documentation revolves around an engineering notebook (stylized ENB), where we extensively document all of our work and our meetings throughout the season, as well as a more summarized engineering portfolio. 
                            Design consists of CAD  (computer aided design) work, which is used to envision our robot before it is built, and to model parts for the robot which we then 3D print. 
                            Finally, hardware is the main work coming up with and building a successful robot for competing in the main competitions.

                            The 2022-2023 FTC season game is POWERPLAY. 
                            The POWERPLAY challenge features game elements such as Cones, Junctions, Substations, and Terminals. 
                            At the start of the match, each robot begins against their alliance wall and is able to be pre-loaded with one cone. 
                            Once the match starts, teams race to score cones and create circuits during the thirty second autonomous period followed by the two minute driver controlled period. 
                            During the last thirty seconds of the match called the end game, teams continue to score cones and have the opportunity to cap a junction with a beacon and park in their alliance's terminal for extra points.
